## Executive Summary <!---What are the Three Things You Need to Know-->

QE is an unconventional monetary policy where the Federal Reserve buys long-term financial assets (mainly Treasury and mortgage-backed securities) in order to increase the money supply and lower long-term interest rates. 

-  The Fed resorted to this measure after having exhausted its usual methods of stimulating economic growth, namely lowering short-term interest rates through purchases of short-term Treasury securities.

## Why is this Important?

QE raises the prices of financial assets (stock, bonds, mortgage backed securities).  This is equivalent to lowering interest rates consumers pay.  So the effect's of QE are felt by all those in the economy.

- QE also affecs the value of the US dollar.  If the dollars created through QE are invested abroad, this will put downward pressure on the US dollar.

- 


<!--- QE has been the largest monetary policy intervention in modern times.

- Over $X trillon has been created by the Fed. -->

## Mechanics

When the Fed buy securities, it creates US dollars.
