## The FOMC

The FOMC is the committee within the Fed which controls monetary policy.

- Monetary policy is the control of the money supply (often through targeting an interest rate). 
- The stated goal of our monetary policy is 'maximum employment and price stability'. 
- The FOMC is also concerned with other real economic variables (GDP, production, etc). 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## FOMC Members

The FOMC is comprised of the 7 members of the Board of Governors, the President of the New York Fed, and the Presidents of 4 Fed District Banks.  The Fed District Bank members rotate.

- The Chairperson of the Board of Governors serves and the Chairperson of the FOMC.

## Why is the FOMC Important 

All asset values in the economy are simply the present value of the expected cash flows (where the discount rate reflects the risk in the cash flows).  

- When the FOMC raises interest rates, it pushes up the discount rate on all assets, thereby lowering asset values.  

- Conversely, a lower interest rate lowers the discount rate on all assets and raises asset values.

Thus in FOMC communications, the market listens closely for any hints of future interest rate changes as an indicator of future asset values.

## FOMC Meetings

The FOMC holds 8 meeting per year.  

- About 2 weeks prior to each meeting the FOMC members receive the *Beige Book* for each of the Fed's 12 districts.  The Beige Book contains a report on regional economic conditions.

- Each FOMC meeting starts with staff member presentations on current economic conditions.  

- Then each FOMC member has the opportunity to provide a recommendation to the committee regarding changes to the Federal Funds rate.  The chairperson also offers a recommendation.

- The members then vote.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## FOMC Statement

The committee then issues a statement summarizing its outlook and decision. 

- Since 2007 the committee also votes on the statement.

- Prior to 2007, the FOMC's language was often vague and difficult for the layperson to interpret.  Since, the FOMC has tried to make its language more clear. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Implementation

The FOMC then sends its monetary policy decision to the trading desk at the FRB New York in the form of a statement called the *policy directive*. 

- This directive contains the target Federal Funds rate.

- The trading desk then buys or sells Treasury securities (open market operations) to target the rate. The desk has also traded other securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) in support of Quantitative Easing.

- Open market operations continue through the year, and it is just the targets which change with each policy directive.

- The FOMC can issue policy directives between FOMC scheduled meetings if necessary.

## Word Cloud App

The following app will allow you to choose any FOMC statement and see its word cloud.

- Note the consistent use of the term 'inflation'.

- Take a look at the change in terms around the 2008 financial crisis.

## Understanding FOMC Phrases

Historically the FOMC language was intentionally vague. They have recently tried to make it more clear and meaningful.  

-  The following app allows you to choose some common FOMC phrases and see its translation in everyday terms.
