## Crude Oil: A Brief History 

The first modern well was spud in 1859 near Titusville in western Pennsylvania.

- Around the same time oil was being produced (first by digging then by drilling) in Ontario, Canada.

- Much of this oil was refined into kerosene.

## Lucas Gusher at Spindletop

The Texas oil boom was kicked off in 1901, when oil was found in the Spindletop field in Beaumont, Texas.

## Prices Through 1973

Crude oil prices didn't fluctuate much prior to 1973.

- A set of US oil companies (*Seven Sisters*) held the price stable with production controls.

- After the Yom Kippur war in 1973, control of crude oil prices transferred to OPEC.  Prices then became more volatile. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Crude Oil Price Benchmarks

Three types of oil serve as global benchmarks for other oil prices.  They are:

1.  West Texas Intermediate (WTI):  US price benchmark.

2.  Brent North Sea:  European price benchmark.

3.  Dubai: Asian price benchmark. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Crude Oil Grades

Crude oil is graded by density (light/heavy) and sulphur (sweet/sour) content.  

- Low density (light) and low sulphur (sweet) is cheaper to refine than more heavy and sour crude oil.

-  For example, both WTI and Brent are light sweet crudes (but WTI is lighter and sweeter), whereas Dubai is medium sour.

- For this reason, historically (prior to 2010) WTI has traded at a premium to Brent.  Since 2010 the difference in grade has been more than offset by the supply of crude from North Dakota and the western Canadian provinces.

## US Crude Oil Production

The US produces about 8 million barrels of crude per day.  

-  US production has increased since the introduction of technology to extract tight oil (oil from shale formations such as the Bakken formation in western North Dakota).

## US Crude Oil Consumption

The US consumes about 18 million barrels of crude oil per day.  

- Crude oil is primarily refined into gasoline, diesel fuel, and heating oil.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## US Crude Export Restrictions

Crude oil exports are restricted by the 'Energy Policy and Conservation Act' of 1975, which directs the President “to promulgate a rule prohibiting the export of crude oil” produced in the US.  This act was passed after the OPEC embargo.

- Given the recent production increase in the US, there is pressure for the President to allow increased exports.

## Crude Oil and the Macroeconomy

The International Monetary Fund (IMF (2000)) estimated a \$5 increase in crude oil prices reduces global economic growth by 0.3\% in the following year. 

Also since crude oil is used in the transport and production of many goods, it is a prominent driver of inflation.

-  Accordingly it is closely watched by the Federal Reserve when setting monetary policy.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Crude Oil and the Stock Market

Sharp increases in oil prices tend to lower stock prices. 

- Research (Jones and Kaul (1996)) has shown that market participants accurately estimate the effect of higher oil prices on firm cash flows, and lower stock prices accordingly.  

- Additional research shows oil may even be able to predict *future* stock market returns (Driesprong, Jacobsen, Maat (2008)).
