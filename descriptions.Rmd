## Topic and Concept Descriptions

### Risk

Risk is the estimation of the size and probability of adverse events. The calculation of risk is heavily dependent on assumptions regarding security behavior.   Topics in risk will show different ways to measure, observe, and understand risk in modern markets.

#### A First Look At Risk

This interactive presentation covers how to measure risk in financial markets and the assumptions which go into various measures.  It also lets you investigate how risk differs among securities.

#### Risk Over Time 

This interactive presentation allows you to explore how risk changes dynamically over time, and discusses the implications of time-varying risk. It also looks at market measures of future risk. 

#### The VIX Index

The VIX index is the stock market's *fear gauge*. This presentation discusses the calculation of the VIX, its historical performance, and how it can be used. 

#### VVIX: The Vol of Vol

The VVIX index tracks the volatility of the VIX. This presentation discusses the purpose and performance of the VVIX. 

### Portfolio Finance

Topics in Portfolio Finance cover how to construct portfolios which have the highest return *per unit risk*.  That is, it covers the idea and mathematics of balancing risk and return. Beyond portfolio construction, we also cover portfolio performance measurement and attribution.

#### An Introduction to Portfolio Performance Measures 

How do you rate a portfolio (and portfolio manager's) performance?  We have to balance the portfolio's return, with the risk taken to earn that return, to get the return per unit risk.  However there are various measures of risk, and so various performance measures, which you can explore in this presentation. 

### Corporate Finance

A main goal of Corporate Finance is to learn how to decide whether to invest in a project or not.  Toward this end we learn how to estimate cash flows, move those cash flows in time, and estimate risk on the cash flows.  We then can value stock, bonds, and employ investment decision rules (i.e. NPV and IRR).  

### Econometrics

Econometrics is statistical analysis applied to questions in economics and finance. The branch is driven by unique situations in economics and finance requiring specialized methods, such as errors-in-variables problems and the need for models of heteroskedasticity in finance.  

### Trading and Market Structure

Market structure covers how trading is organized, and how this affects liquidity and price discovery.  We also cover how trading takes place in various markets, the types of orders you can enter, and using margin.  

### Derivatives

Derivatives are securities whose payoffs are dependent on other events.  These events can be other security prices or events such as hurricanes and snowfall.  We cover types of derivatives and their valuation, how to use them for risk management and speculation, and the various derivative markets.  

### Fixed Income and Other Debt

Fixed income and debt markets cover sovereign (such as US Treasury), municipal, corporate, and mortgage and other consumer debt.  Collectively these markets are huge---the US Treasury market alone is over $18 trillion with about $500 billion per day in average trading volume.  

### Foreign Exchange

Foreign exchange markets are enable exchanging currency in support of international trade and investment. In these presentation we learn about the various currencies and derivatives traded in these market.  The derivatives are used to manage risk in cross-border trade and investment.  We also cover arbitrage in the various currency markets.  

### Equity 

Equity represents ownership in a corporation, and has a residual claim on corporate earnings.  We'll also cover how the payoff structure (residual claim) affects equity holder preferences for corporate risk taking.  

### Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is the control of the money supply to achieve goals, such as in the United States, to provide stable prices and maximum employment.  These presentations will cover how monetary policy makers make decisions, as well as the mechanisms used to control the money supply.  

#### Fed Communications

Given the influence the US Federal Reserve has over security markets, the Fed is very careful in its communication with markets.  This interactive presentation covers the manner in which the Fed communicates, and lets you explore various Fed statements and how they have evolved over time.  The presentation will also translate careful Fed statements into everyday language. 

### Commodities

We cover trading and risk management in commodity markets.  Commodities are generally products which serve as raw materials for industrial processes. Examples of commodities are natural gas, wheat, and feeder cattle.

#### Crude Oil Markets
