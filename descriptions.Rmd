## Topic and Concept Descriptions

### Risk

Risk is the estimation of the size and probability of adverse events. The calculation of risk is heavily dependent on assumptions regarding security behavior.   Topics in risk will show different ways to measure, observe, and understand risk in modern markets.

#### A First Look At Risk

This interactive presentation covers how to measure risk in financial markets and the assumptions which go into various measures.  It also lets you investigate how risk differs among securities.

#### Risk Over Time 

This interactive presentation allows you to explore how risk changes dynamically over time, and discusses the implications of time-varying risk. It also looks at market measures of future risk. 

#### The VIX Index

The VIX index is the stock market's *fear gauge*. This presentation discusses the calculation of the VIX, its historical performance, and how it can be used. 

#### VVIX: The Vol of Vol

The VVIX index tracks the volatility of the VIX. This presentation discusses the purpose and performance of the VVIX. 

### Portfolio Finance

Topics in Portfolio Finance cover how to construct portfolios which have the highest return *per unit risk*.  That is, it covers the idea and mathematics of balancing risk and return. Beyond portfolio construction, we also cover portfolio performance measurement and attribution.

#### An Introduction to Portfolio Performance Measures 

How do you rate a portfolio (and portfolio manager's) performance?  We have to balance the portfolio's return, with the risk taken to earn that return, to get the return per unit risk.  However there are various measures of risk, and so various performance measures, which you can explore in this presentation. 

### Corporate Finance

A main goal of Corporate Finance is to learn how to decide whether to invest in a project or not.  Toward this end we learn how to estimate cash flows, move those cash flows in time, and estimate risk on the cash flows.  We then can value stock, bonds, and employ investment decision rules (i.e. NPV and IRR).  

#### An Introduction to Financial Statements

Financial statements report corporate profitability (income statement) and capital structure (balance sheet).  In finance we often use these statements to calculate cash flows for valuations and to estimate how much debt a company can manage. 

#### Financial Ratios

Financial ratios use data contained in financial statements to calculate characteristics of a company.  For example a ratio of total debt divided by total equity is a measure of the firm's leverage.  The ratio controls for firm size, enabling us to compare firms.

#### Time Value of Money: Single Cash Flows

Most analyses in finance, such as valuations, require moving cash flows to different points in time.  This presentation will teach you the mechanics to do so, and also provide interactive elements to help you get an intuitive feel for the interrelationships between time, interest rate, and values.

#### Time Value of Money: Multiple Cash Flows

This presentation covers the valuation of common financial contracts with multiple cash flows such as mortgages (an annuity) and preferred stock (a perpetuity).  Interactive apps are included to value these contracts.

#### Operating Cash Flow

We calculate operating cash flow from financial statements, and it tells us how much cash the firm generates.  The cash flows are used to value the firm, and also determine debt capacity.

#### Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return

Net present value and the internal rate of return are the two most widely used investment decision rules. They are used by corporations to decide whether to accept a project.   

#### An Introduction to Stock Valuation

A widely used method of stock valuation is by discounting expected dividends.  This presentation will show you how to value stock given varying assumptions about dividend payment structure. The interactive apps will give you an intuitive understanding of how stock values relate to dividends, dividend growth rates, and discount rates.  

#### An Introduction to Bond Valuation

This presentation shows how to value coupon bonds, and provides interactive apps where you can calculate bond values and yield-to-maturities.  

#### The Capital Asset Pricing Model 

The capital asset pricing model is the most widely used way to calculate the cost of a firm's equity.  In this presentation we give you an understanding of what the model assumes and says, as well as the ability to visualize the cost of equity for any stock.

### Econometrics

Econometrics is statistical analysis applied to questions in economics and finance. The branch is driven by unique situations in economics and finance requiring specialized methods, such as errors-in-variables problems and the need for models of heteroskedasticity in finance.  

### Trading and Market Structure

Market structure covers how trading is organized, and how this affects liquidity and price discovery.  We also cover how trading takes place in various markets, the types of orders you can enter, and using margin.  

### Derivatives

Derivatives are securities whose payoffs are dependent on other events.  These events can be other security prices or events such as hurricanes and snowfall.  We cover types of derivatives and their valuation, how to use them for risk management and speculation, and the various derivative markets.  

### Fixed Income and Other Debt

Fixed income and debt markets cover sovereign (such as US Treasury), municipal, corporate, and mortgage and other consumer debt.  Collectively these markets are huge---the US Treasury market alone is over $18 trillion with about $500 billion per day in average trading volume.  

### Foreign Exchange

Foreign exchange markets are enable exchanging currency in support of international trade and investment. In these presentation we learn about the various currencies and derivatives traded in these market.  The derivatives are used to manage risk in cross-border trade and investment.  We also cover arbitrage in the various currency markets.  

### Equity 

Equity represents ownership in a corporation, and has a residual claim on corporate earnings.  We'll also cover how the payoff structure (residual claim) affects equity holder preferences for corporate risk taking.  

### Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is the control of the money supply to achieve goals, such as in the United States, to provide stable prices and maximum employment.  These presentations will cover how monetary policy makers make decisions, as well as the mechanisms used to control the money supply.  

#### Fed Communications

Given the influence the US Federal Reserve has over security markets, the Fed is very careful in its communication with markets.  This interactive presentation covers the manner in which the Fed communicates, and lets you explore various Fed statements and how they have evolved over time.  The presentation will also translate careful Fed statements into everyday language. 

### Commodities

We cover trading and risk management in commodity markets.  Commodities are generally products which serve as raw materials for industrial processes. Examples of commodities are natural gas, wheat, and feeder cattle.

#### Crude Oil Markets
