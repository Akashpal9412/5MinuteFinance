## Topic and Concept Descriptions

### Risk

Risk is the estimation of the size and probability of adverse events. The calculation of risk is heavily dependent on assumptions regarding security behavior.   Topics in risk will show different ways to measure, observe, and understand risk in modern markets.

### Portfolio Finance

Topics in Portfolio Finance cover how to construct portfolios which have the highest return *per unit risk*.  That is, it covers the idea and mathematics of balancing risk and return. Beyond portfolio construction, we also cover portfolio performance measurement and attribution.

### Corporate Finance

A main goal of Corporate Finance is to learn how to decide whether to invest in a project or not.  Toward this end we learn how to estimate cash flows, move those cash flows in time, and estimate risk on the cash flows.  We then can value stock, bonds, and employ investment decision rules (i.e. NPV and IRR).  

### Econometrics



### Trading and Market Structure

Market structure covers how trading is organized, and how this affects liquidity and price discovery.  We also cover how trading takes place in various markets.  

### Derivatives

Derivatives are securities whose payoffs are dependent on other events.  These events can be other security prices or events such as hurricanes and snowfall.

### Fixed Income and Other Debt

### Foreign Exchange

### Equity 

Equity represents ownership in a corporation, and has a residual claim on corporate earnings.  We'll also cover how the payoff structure (residual claim) affects equity holder preferences for corporate risk taking.  

### Monetary Policy

Monetary policy is the control of the money supply to achieve goals, such as in the United States, to provide stable prices and maximum employment.  These presentations will cover how monetary policy makers make decisions, as well as the mechanisms used to control the money supply.  

### Commodities

We cover trading and risk management in commodity markets.  Commodities are generally products which serve as raw materials for industrial processes. Examples of commodities are natural gas, wheat, and feeder cattle.
