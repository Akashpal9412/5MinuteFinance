## Introduction

When you own a company's stock, you have a residual claim on the company's income.

- This means you get whatever is left over after all others are paid. This could be \$0, or a fortune. 

- This is unlike bondholders, who are promised a set payment. 

- Stock also represents ownership, which affords the holder rights such as electing board members, and voting on corporate actions.

## Limited Liability

As a stock holder you are not liable for the company's debts.

-  This means if the company goes bankrupt, the unpaid bondholders or other claimants cannot try to get the money from you.

-  Because of limited liability, stock prices cannot fall below \$0.

## Gains from Ownership

Stockholders may gain from owning stock by receiving dividends, and through price appreciation.

-  Dividends are payments the corporation makes to stockholders using *after-tax* income.  Companies are not obligated to pay dividends.

-  Price appreciation (capital gains) refers to selling stock for a price higher than you bought the stock.

## Trading Stock

Stock is traded on many exchanges across the US.

-  There are [18 national securities exchanges](http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrexchanges.shtml) registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

- Many of these exchanges are Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs), which are located in a computer server. 

- The best quotes across all exchanges are reported in the "Consolidated Tape", which ensures investors receive the best price across all exchanges when they buy or sell stock.

## Stock Quotes

We get stock quotes, like those below, from the consolidated tape.

-  The last trade could have taken place on any exchange. 

-  Input a ticker and get the most recent quote.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#{{{
library(quantmod)
## library(DT)
inputPanel(
    textInput(inputId = "ticker3", label = "Stock Ticker", value = "AAPL")
    )
div(renderDataTable({
    validate(
        need(input$ticker3 != "", "Input a valid US stock ticker.")
        )

    getQuote(input$ticker3)
}), style = "font-size:60%")
#}}}
```

## Stock Analysis

Methods to predict future stock performance generally fall into two categories, fundamental and technical analysis.

- Fundamental analysis uses financial statement data to identify companies which are undervalued or are likely to grow.

- Technical analysis uses past prices to predict future prices.

- An interactive chart with some common technical analysis indicators is on the next slide.

## Historical Stock Performance

Stock has historically been one of the best performing asset classes [link to relative performance of asset classes presentation].

-  While stock returns have been quite high, stock returns are also volatile.

[graphic: stock plot with high and lows and people wealthy and poor respectively]

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## 

In the following interactive app, you can chart stock going as far back as 1950.

- Moving the mouse over the chart at any date will tell you the stock price on that date.

- You can also change the date window using the selector at the bottom.

- You can plot the S&P 500 index by using <code>^GSPC</code> as the ticker.
