- The stock market has since evolved into a purely electronic interconnection of market makers spread out among about 18 exchanges across the US.  

- Each individual exchange is a system of computer servers which run an order matching engine.  An order matching engine received orders and then handles them according to a series of rules. 

- In 2005 the SEC released Regulation National Market System which tries to ensure that investors receive the best bid and ask price available across the many markets.
