<!-- ## What should make sense by the end of this presentation: -->

<!-- -  Why we may not be able to finance a single $100,000 asset alone, but we can finance a portfolio of 500 of these same assets. -->

<!-- -  The parameters of the assets in the securitization which greatly affect the security's performance.  **Correlation is key.** -->

<!-- -  The participants and regulatory constraints. -->

## Securitization means ...

The transformation of a set of (generally) illiquid assets into a tradeable portfolio of these assets.

-  A classic example is a set of mortgage loans.  Each loan alone is not a tradeable security, however a portfolio of thousands of mortgages can be packaged and turned into a security.

-  However we can securitize a side variety of assets---David Bowie famously securitized royalty payments for his songs.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## What can we securitize? 

We can securitize any asset which generates a stream of cash flows.  These are often financial assets such as loans, but can also be leases and other trade receivables.

To securitize an asset it is necessary to be able to estimate parameters of the assets' cash flows, such as expected cash flows and the standard deviation.  The ownership of the assets must also be transferable.

Assets are more appropriate for securitization if:

-  they provide diversification---geographic or economic.

-  there is a large number of assets.

-  there correlation structure is known, and the assets preferably have low correlations.  Correlation is key...

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Why securitize assets? 

There are many benefits to securitization such as:

-  diversification

-  financial engineering---structuring tranches to meet risk-reward profiles, and investment horizons, desired by present market participants. This allows us to target risk/return profiles which are desirable to a **much** larger pool of investors.

-  increased liquidity.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

##

-  lower transaction costs to transfer assets in a secondary market.

-  it moves illiquid assets off of a firm's balance sheet (where they may be subject to a higher discount rate).  The originator receives a lump sum in exchange for future payments.

-  Ultimately, securitization may allow the financing of assets that would not receive financing individually.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Background and History

Securitization was an effectively non-existent industry in the 1970s, and has since grown to annual issuance in the trillions of dollars.

- In the 1970s Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie MAc started prividing a guarantee on mortgage pass-through securities.  This made obtaining mortgage financing much easier for consumers, because securitization allowed lenders to easily move mortgages off their balance sheet if they needed to, or were concerned about interes rate risk.

- These MBS were successful, and in an attempt to widen the investor base Fannie Mae issued the first Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO) in 1983.  CMOs sought to address pre-payment risk in MBS by separating the security into tranches which determine payment precedence.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Background and History Continued

-  In 1985 Sperry Lease Finance Corp. securitized computer equipment leases in one of the first Asset Backed Security (ABS) offerings.  Since it has become common to securitize auto loans, credit card receivables, student loans, entertainment royalties, and home equity loans among other assets.

## Steps in the Securitization Process

#.  Assets are created.  For example this is the origination of a loan.

#.  A special purpose vehicle (SPV) is created and ownership of the assets is transferred to the SPV.  The original owners receive a sales price.

#.  A claim structure, and credit enhancements, are added to the cash flows generated by the assets in the SPV.  The SPV issues the claims as securities.

#.  NRSROs rate the claims.  This is important from a regulatory standpoint.  It affects who can purchase the securities.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Isolation

A key point of securitization is to isolate the assets (and the cash flows they generate) from the originator of the assets.

-  The originator may thereafter act as a servicer of the assets, but ultimately is not liable for payments.

-  The transfer of ownership from the originator to the SPV is a "true sale".

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Participants in the Securitization

Investors:  households, institutions, and governments.  Affected by whether NRSROs rate the security as "investment-grade".

Originator:  entity who initially originated the loan or asset.

Special Purpose Vehicle:  a legally separate entity which holds the assets bought from the originator.

Trust:  the assets may be held by the SPV, or ultimately transferred to a trust.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Participants Continued ...

Underwriters:  guarantee sufficient payment for the securities, from investors, to the SPV or trust.  These are often investment banks who also assist in structuring the securitization.

Dealers:  make a secondary market in the security.

Rating agencies (NRSROs):  determine the likelihood of default (amount of credit risk) in the security. This is done on an ongoing basis.  Such ratings are not required if the security will be sold in a private placement, however most ABS and MBS are rated.  The ratings determine which sets of investors can buy the security.

Insurers:  Private companies and government agencies ensure payment for a fee or through credit default swaps.

Servicers:  collects payments from borrowers (or asset) and forwards them through to the SPV.  The servicer earns a fee for this work.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Credit Enhancement

There are various types of *Credit Enhancement* which may be used to lessen the risk borne by investors in a securitization.  A few common examples are below:

- Tranching: assigning subsets of the security first, second, third, etc claim on the cash flows from the underlying assets.  Cash flows form a *waterfall* down through the tranches, and so losses are incurred from the bottom tranche up.  This doesn't lessen the risk of the overall security---just transfers risk from one subset of the security's investors to another.

- Overcollateralization: the security collateral exceeds the value of the security ensuring, that even with some default on underlying assets, the security can make timely payments.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Credit Enhancement Continued 

- Third-party guarantee:  an entity assumes some of the bondholders' risk.  This may be through forms of bond insurance, and maybe purchased form private entities, or often the government (for example the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the U.S.).

<!-- add the pros below to the earlier benefits section -->

## Securitization: Pros

-  Effective in funding assets and lowering borrower costs for individuals and corporations, which enables financing for many those deemed subprime.

-  Enables a secondary market.

-  Originators can immediately realize the value of an asset which will produce cash flows over later time periods. This allows the originator to initiate new loans.

-  Separates the credit rating of the originator from the security.  This means the security can have a higher credit rating (and therefore lower yield) that if it were help on the originators balance sheet.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## 

-  Facilitates geographic dispersion of funding to areas underserved by depository institutions.

-  Issuers can tailor the maturity, yield, and seniority to suit investor preference. 

-  Financial flexibility for the originator---makes it much for efficient to move assets off the balance sheet (possibly increasing ROA).

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Securitization: Cons

-  This process relies on the investors ability to determine the underlying asset credit risk, and thereby relies on credit rating agencies.  If the risk is assessed incorrectly, this will cause misallocation of funds.  This can be exacerbated by complex capital structures, the separation of ownership and origination (originate-to-distribute), and the origination incentive system.  Since securitizations is a power tool to funnel capital to borrowes, the misallocation of this capital may cause substantial distortions, such as in the housing market prior to 2008.

-  See [Securitization: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2013/wp13255.pdf) for a good summary of how components of the securitization process failed in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis.

## Taxonomy

-  Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS):  backed by a portfolio of residential and/or comercial mortgages.

-  Asset-Backed Security (ABS):  generic term for security backed by non-mortgage loans or other assets which generate expected cash flows.  

-  Collateralized Mortgage Obligation (CMO):  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## An Example

Mortgage and auto loans, and credit card receivables, are commonly securitized assets.  This has made more money available for these types of loans, and thereby eased the difficulties for consumers seeking financing.

-  However, other types of assets can be securitized, and while the securities based on these assets are small relative to mortgage securities, the assets can benefit greatly from the securitization.

-  For example, [MIT's Andrew Lo is attempting to use securitization to enable funding of potential cancer cures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu86bYKVmRE).  We'll discuss this securitization in the following section.

<!-- -  As an example, similar to Andrew Los' priject, we'll securitize a portfolio of cancer realted pharma patents. -->

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The Problem

The risks and costs of biomedical research have increased due to underlying factors in the research and approval process.  This has lessened the ability of traditional public and private equity to finance such research---particular given their investment horizon constraints and more stringent requirements on real-time pricing of investments.

-  This has caused a funding gap in biomed research, often referred to as the "valley of death".

-  In 2010 \$48 billion was spent on basic research in drug development, \$7 billion was spent on translating that into marketable componds, and \$52 billion was spent on clinical development (Fagnan et al 2013).

-  Attempts are being made to use securitization structures to fund biomed research through selling "Research Backed Obligations", which importantly have bond-like tranches, and investment horizons which are acceptable to investors.

-  The primary market for bonds is much larger than equity.

## Example of the Effect of Diversification

Assume the following cash flows for an investment in drug-development if the drug is a success.

| Year     | 0       | 1 through 10 | 11 through 20 |
|:------|:------:|:---------:|:------:|
| Cash Flow| -$200MM | $0           | $2B/year  |

and the following cash flows if the drug is unsuccessful.

| Year     | 0       | 1 through 10 | 11 through 20 |
|:------|:------:|:---------:|:------:|
| Cash Flow| -$200MM | $0           | $0  |

Further assume the probability of success is 5% (and so a 95% chance that a given drug will be unsuccessful).

## Assumptions


<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 



<!-- Securitize pharma patent cash flows instead of power plant below -->

<!-- ## An Example -->

<!-- Assume a start-up firm is attempting to provide distributed solar power generation to towns across Sub-Saharan Africa.  Some aspect of the project are: -->

<!-- -  Each solar facility is 10MW. -->

<!-- -  The cost of producing each facility is declining in the number of facilities produced (according to a schedule provided in a later slide ). -->

<!-- -  Each facility has a 10 year life. -->

<!-- -  Cash flows are uncorrelated across facilities. -->

<!-- <div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div>  -->

<!-- ## Project Costs -->

<!-- | \# of Facilities | Cost per Facility | -->
<!-- |-------|-----| -->
<!-- | 0-10 | $1MM | -->
<!-- | 11-20 | $0.8MM | -->
<!-- | 21-30 | $0.6MM | -->

<!-- <div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div>  -->

<!-- ## Project Operating Cash Flow -->

<!-- We expect each to earn $0.215 per MWh for the 7x16 interval (16 hours per day).  We don't expect the facility to deliver power over the remaining 7x8 interval. -->
