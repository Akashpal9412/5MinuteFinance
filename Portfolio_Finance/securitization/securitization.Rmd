## Securitization means ...

The transformation of a set of (generally) illiquid assets into a tradeable portfolio of these assets.

-  A classic example is a set of mortgage loans.  Each loan alone is not a tradeable security, however a portfolio of thousands of mortgages can be packaged and turned into a security.

## What can we securitize? 

We can securitize any asset which generates a stream of cash flows---David Bowie famously securitized royalty payment for his songs.  To securitize an asset it is necessary to be able to estimate parameters of the assets' cash flows, such as expected cash flows and the standard deviation.  The ownership of the assets must also be transferable.

Assets are more appropriate for securitization if:

-  they provide diversification---geographic or economic.

-  there is a large number of assets.

## Why securitize assets? 

There are many benefits to securitization such as:

-  diversification

-  increased liquidity

-  it moves illiquid assets off of a firm's balance sheet (where they may be subject to a higher discount rate).

## Steps in the Securitization Process

#.  Assets are created.  For example this is the origination of a loan, or the creation of a patent.

#.  Ownership of the assets is transferred to a special purpose vehicle (SPV).  The original owners receive a sales price.

#.  A claim structure is added to the cash flows generated by the assets in the SPV.  The SPV issues the claims as securities.

#.  NRSROs rate the claims.

## An Example

Mortgage and auto loans, and credit card receivables, are commonly securitized assets.  This has made more money available for these types of loans, and thereby eased the difficulties for consumers seeking financing.

-  However, other types of assets can be securitized, and while the securities based on these assets are small relative to mortgage securities, the assets can benefit greatly from the securitization.

-  For example, [MIT's Andrew Lo is attempting to use securitization to enable funding of potential cancer cures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu86bYKVmRE).

## An Example

Assume a start-up firm is attempting to provide distributed solar power generation to towns across Sub-Saharan Africa.  Some aspect of the project are:

-  Each solar facility is 10MW.

-  The cost of producing each facility is declining in the number of facilities produced (according to a schedule provided in a later slide ).

-  Each facility has a 10 year life.

## Project Costs

| \# of Facilities | Cost per Facility |
|-------|-----|
| 0-10 | $1MM |
| 11-20 | $0.8MM |
| 21-30 | $0.6MM |

## Project Operating Cash Flow

We expect each to earn $0.115 per MWh for the 5x16 interval (16 hours per day over the weekdays).
