## What should make sense by the end of this presentation:

-  Why we may not be able to finance a single $100,000 asset alone, but we can finance a portfolio of 500 of these same assets.

-  The parameters of the assets in the securitization which greatly affect the security's performance.  **Correlation is key.**


<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Securitization means ...

The transformation of a set of (generally) illiquid assets into a tradeable portfolio of these assets.

-  A classic example is a set of mortgage loans.  Each loan alone is not a tradeable security, however a portfolio of thousands of mortgages can be packaged and turned into a security.

-  However we can securitize a side variety of assets---David Bowie famously securitized royalty payments for his songs.

## What can we securitize? 

We can securitize any asset which generates a stream of cash flows.  To securitize an asset it is necessary to be able to estimate parameters of the assets' cash flows, such as expected cash flows and the standard deviation.  The ownership of the assets must also be transferable.

Assets are more appropriate for securitization if:

-  they provide diversification---geographic or economic.

-  there is a large number of assets.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Why securitize assets? 

There are many benefits to securitization such as:

-  diversification

-  financial engineering---structuring tranches to meet risk-reward profiles, and investment horizons, desired by present market participants. This allows us to target risk/return profiles which are desirable to a **much** larger pool of investors.

-  increased liquidity

-  it moves illiquid assets off of a firm's balance sheet (where they may be subject to a higher discount rate).  The originator receives a lump sum in exchange for future payments.

## Background and History

From Moody's, ["Securitization Finances 30% of US Capital Markets Funding Needs Annually and 40% Historically"](https://www.moodys.com/sites/products/ProductAttachments/Spotlight%20on%20structured%20finance.pdf)

## Steps in the Securitization Process

#.  Assets are created.  For example this is the origination of a loan, or the creation of a patent.

#.  Ownership of the assets is transferred to a special purpose vehicle (SPV).  The original owners receive a sales price.

#.  A claim structure, and credit enhancements, are added to the cash flows generated by the assets in the SPV.  The SPV issues the claims as securities.

#.  NRSROs rate the claims.  This is important from a regulatory standpoint.  It affects who can purchase the securities.

## Participants in the Securitization

## Lessening Risk

There are various types of *Credit Enhancement* which may be used to lessen the risk borne by investors in a securitization.  A few common examples are below:

- Tranching: assigning subsets of the security first, second, third, etc claim on the cash flows from the underlying assets.  Cash flows form a *waterfall* down through the tranches, and so losses are incurred from the bottom tranche up.  This doesn't lessen the risk of the overall security---just transfers risk from one subset of the security's investors to another.

- Overcollateralization: the security collateral exceeds the value of the security ensuring, that even with some default on underlying assets, the security can make timely payments.

- Third-party guarantee:  an entity assumes some of the bondholders' risk.  This may be through forms of bond insurance, and maybe purchased form private entities, or often the government (for example the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the U.S.).

## An Example

Mortgage and auto loans, and credit card receivables, are commonly securitized assets.  This has made more money available for these types of loans, and thereby eased the difficulties for consumers seeking financing.

-  However, other types of assets can be securitized, and while the securities based on these assets are small relative to mortgage securities, the assets can benefit greatly from the securitization.

-  For example, [MIT's Andrew Lo is attempting to use securitization to enable funding of potential cancer cures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xu86bYKVmRE).  We'll discuss this securitization in the following section.

<!-- -  As an example, similar to Andrew Los' priject, we'll securitize a portfolio of cancer realted pharma patents. -->

## The Problem

The risks and costs of biomedical research have increased due to underlying factors in the research and approval process.  This has lessened the ability of traditional public and private equity to finance such research---particular given their investment horizon constraints and more stringent requirements on real-time pricing of investments.

-  This has caused a funding gap in biomed research, often referred to as the "valley of death".

-  Attempts are being made to use securitization structures to fund biomed research through selling "Research Backed Obligations", which importantly have bond-like tranches, and investment horizons which are acceptable to investors.

-  The primary market for bonds is much larger than equity.

## Example of the Effect of Diversification

Assume the following cash flows for an investment in drug-development if the drug is a success.

| Year     | 0       | 1 through 10 | 11 through 20 |
|:------|:------:|:---------:|:------:|
| Cash Flow| -$200MM | $0           | $2B/year  |

and the following cash flows if the drug is unsuccessful.

| Year     | 0       | 1 through 10 | 11 through 20 |
|:------|:------:|:---------:|:------:|
| Cash Flow| -$200MM | $0           | $0  |

Further assume the probability of success is 5% (and so a 95% chance that a given drug will be unsuccessful).

## Assumptions


<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 



<!-- Securitize pharma patent cash flows instead of power plant below -->

<!-- ## An Example -->

<!-- Assume a start-up firm is attempting to provide distributed solar power generation to towns across Sub-Saharan Africa.  Some aspect of the project are: -->

<!-- -  Each solar facility is 10MW. -->

<!-- -  The cost of producing each facility is declining in the number of facilities produced (according to a schedule provided in a later slide ). -->

<!-- -  Each facility has a 10 year life. -->

<!-- -  Cash flows are uncorrelated across facilities. -->

<!-- <div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div>  -->

<!-- ## Project Costs -->

<!-- | \# of Facilities | Cost per Facility | -->
<!-- |-------|-----| -->
<!-- | 0-10 | $1MM | -->
<!-- | 11-20 | $0.8MM | -->
<!-- | 21-30 | $0.6MM | -->

<!-- <div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div>  -->

<!-- ## Project Operating Cash Flow -->

<!-- We expect each to earn $0.215 per MWh for the 7x16 interval (16 hours per day).  We don't expect the facility to deliver power over the remaining 7x8 interval. -->
