## The Role of Speculators

Speculators play an important role by taking the other side of order imbalances between hedgers. Without speculators, hedgers would have to wait for other hedgers to trade (causing the market maker to widen bid-ask spreads).  

-  Speculators temporarily hold in imbalance in exchange for a return.
