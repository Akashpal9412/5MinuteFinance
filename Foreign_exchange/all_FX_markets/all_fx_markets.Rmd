## Foreign Exchange (FX) Markets

This presentation will cover FX spot and derivative markets, and particularly the relationship between these markets.  Questions we'll answer are:

- How closely are movements in derivative markets (options/futures/forwards) tied to movements in spot markets?

- What are the effects of movements in interest rate markets?

- What is the information content generated in each market?
