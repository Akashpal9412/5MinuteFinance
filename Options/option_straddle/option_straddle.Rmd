## Options Review

Remember that an American call option grants the owner the right to buy a share of the underlying stock for the strike price anytime before expiration.

- So, you would want to purchase a call option if you expect the price of the stock to increase

And recall that an American put option grants the owner the right to sell a share of the underlying stock for the strike price anytime before expiration.

- So, you want to purchase a put option if you expect the price of the stock to decrease

## But...

What if you just expect a large change in the stock's price in either direction?

Take the recent Brexit vote, for example. Before the vote, one could have reasonably expected the market to move either up or down (potentially drastically) in response to the outcome.

- In this case, the long straddle would make for a good strategy

## What is the Long Straddle?

The long straddle, or option straddle, is the strategy of purchasing both call and put options at the exact same strike price and expiration date.

Going back to the Brexit example, a call option would've turned a profit if the UK voted Stay and the market went up. Conversely, if the UK voted Leave and the market went down (as it did), a put option would've turned a profit.

- Since there was no way of knowing which way the vote would go beforehand, the option straddle would've been a good strategy to take advantage of a big market shift in either direction

## Interactive Slide

In the next slide, you'll be able to select a strike price and option premium then view the corresponding payoff diagrams for the option straddle.

Note that the breakeven points in the option straddle occur when the underlying stock price 1) falls below strike price - total price of premiums and 2) rises above strike price + total price of preiums

- The shaded regions represent the areas in which the option straddle is profitable

## Long Straddle Analysis

In the payoff diagrams you can see that while loss potential is limited, the profit potential is unlimited.

- Loss can never exceed the total price of premiums paid
- Unlimited upside profit potential
- Limited, but substantial downside profit potential

What effect do you think stock volatility has on the long straddle?

- Since the straddle benefits from large price fluctuations, it makes sense that the option straddle is better for more volatile stocks
