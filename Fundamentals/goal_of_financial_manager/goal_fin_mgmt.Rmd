## Purpose

This presentation will explain the goal of the financial manager.  

-  Importatly, we'll also explain why this measure makes sense, and limits excessive risk-taking. 

-  We'll also discuss other potential measures, and why they would lead to excessive risk taking or other undesirable outcomes.  

-  Lastly, note we are discussing the financial manager of a US corporation.  The goal may differ for managers at non-US companies.

## The Goal

`The goal of financial management is to maximize shareholder wealth.`

## Alternative Measures

Some might offer goals such as `maximize cash flows` or `maximize profit`.  There are some minor problems with these goals, and a major problem.  Minor problems relate to how to measure the cash flows---should they be the average cash flow over some period (and what period)?

-  The major problem is that they will lead to excessive risk taking.

## Excessive Risk

Say the goal was to maximize cash flow.  Assume the following scenario.  

-  Your company has \$100,000 to invest in houses.  Each house costs \$100,000, and their prices will increase by 1\% over the next year. 

-  You are able to borrow up to a maximum of 100-to-1 leverage.
