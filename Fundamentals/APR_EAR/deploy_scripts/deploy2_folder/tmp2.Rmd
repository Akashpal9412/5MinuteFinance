## Quoted Rates

Interest rates are often *quoted* as annual rates, even though the payment and interest period is antually less than a year.  For example, you might see an interest rate quoted as, '8\% compounded semiannually'.  

-  What this actually means is the interest rate is 4\% over 6-months.  

-  Importantly, 8\% over a year is **not** the same return as 4\% over 6 months.  


## 

Because of this the annual 8\% rate is referred to as the *quoted* rate, to make it clear it is not the actual rate earned.  Quoted rates are calculated, by convention, as the rate per period multiplied by the number of periods in a year.

-  In the above example, this is $4\% * 2 = 8\%$ where the $2$ denoted two 6 month periods.  

 
## Effective Annual Rates

We can calculate the EAR with: $EAR = \left(1 + \frac{Q}{m}\right)^m - 1$

-  The idea is this equation is we first take the quoted rate and calculate the rate per period $\frac{Q}{m}$.  This is the actual interest rate.  

-  We then calculate the future value at the end of the year, given an interest rate of $\frac{Q}{m}$ per period, and $m$ periods in a year.  You can think of this as the future value of \$1 invested over the year: $FV = \$1\left(1 + \frac{Q}{m}\right)^m$.  

-  We then subtract the original \$1, to get the amount earned over the year (the EAR).  


## Interactive App

Use the following app to get an idea of how the quoted interest rate and compounding period affect the effective annual rate.

-  Notice the greater the quoted rate, the larget the effect of increasing the compounding period.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
inputPanel(
 sliderInput("quoted", "Quoted Rate", min = 0, max = 50, step = .1, value = 12),
 selectizeInput(inputId = "comp", label = "Number of Periods in a Year", choices = c("Yearly"= "y", "Semiannual" = "s", "Monthly" = "mo", "Daily" = "d", "Infinite" = "i"))
)
renderPlot({
 
  m <- switch(input$comp, "y" = 1, "s" = 2, "mo" = 12, "d" = 365, "i" = 99999999)
  ear <- (1 + (input$quoted / 100) / m)^m - 1
  
  plot(0, ylim = c(0,1), xlim = c(0,1), type = "n", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ylab = "", xlab = "")
  text(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, labels = paste(round( 100 * ear, 2)), cex = 5)
   
})
```
