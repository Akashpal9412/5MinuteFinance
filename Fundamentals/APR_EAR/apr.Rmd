## Quoted Rates

Interest rates are often *quoted* as annual rates, even though the payment and interest period is antually less than a year.  For example, you might see an interest rate quoted as, '8\% compounded semiannually'.  

-  What this actually means is the interest rate is 4\% over 6-months.  

-  Importantly, 8\% over a year is **not** the same return as 4\% over 6 months.

## 

Because of this the annual 8\% rate is referred to as the *quoted* rate, to make it clear it is not the actual rate earned.  Quoted rates are calculated, by convention, as the rate per period multiplied by the number of periods in a year.

-  In the above example, this is $4\% * 2 = 8\%$ where the $2$ denoted two 6 month periods.

## Effective Annual Rates


$EAR = \left(1 + \frac{Q}{m}\right)^m - 1$
