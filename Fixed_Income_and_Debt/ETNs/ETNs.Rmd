## Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs)

ETNs are like ETFs in that they track an financial (stock, bond, commodity, foreign exchange, etc) index and trade throughout the day.

-  The difference is that ETNs are debt securities, whereas ETFs are a type of open-ended mutual fund.  This means they are backed only by the credit of the issuer---wheres in an ETF you have a claim on the underlying assets.

-  Like ETFs, ETNs typically passively match an index's returns.

## New ETFs

While the first ETFs were mainly for broad stock indexes (the NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average for example), their rising popularity of has spurred the creation of ETFs for a variety of underlying assets, such as:

-  Stock sectors: Financials, Energy, etc. 
-  Commodities: Crude Oil, Gold, Natural Gas, among others.
-  Non-Stock Indexes: the VIX volatility index.
-  'Actively managed' ETFs
-  Leveraged ETFs.

## ETN Issuers

There are a few major sponsors of ETFs.  Among them are:

-  [iShares: managed by Blackrock](www.ishares.com/)
-  [Standard & Poor's Depository Receipts: managed by State Street Global Advisors](https://www.spdrs.com/)
-  [PowerShares: managed by Invesco](http://www.invescopowershares.com/)
-  [Market Vectors: managed by Van Eck Global](www.vaneck.com/market-vectors/equity-etfs/)
-  [X-trackers: managed by Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management](www.etf.deutscheawm.com/)

##  How Well Do ETFs Track Their Underlying Index?

The next slide will show you the cumulative returns for the ETF and index you choose.

-  Generally, for the established stock index ETFs, the ETF tracks the index very closely.

-  However, because there are many new and often exotic ETFs introduced each year, one can't make a blanket statement across all ETFs.

## ETFs versus ETNs

-  Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) are unsecured debt obligations of financial institutions.
-  ETNs are also traded on securities exchanges and can be bought or sold on the exchanges.
-  ETNs unlike ETFs do not own a portfolio of underlying assets. ETNs calculate the value using a described formula, rather than using net asset value.
