## Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs)

ETNs are like ETFs in that they passively track an financial (stock, bond, commodity, foreign exchange, etc) index and trade throughout the day.

-  The difference is that ETNs are unsecured debt securities, whereas ETFs are a type of open-ended mutual fund.  This means ETNs are backed only by the credit of the issuer---wheres in an ETF you have a claim on the underlying assets.

-  However, because the ETN doesn't have to buy the assets underlying the fund, there is no tracking error between the ETN and underlying index's returns.  The ETN (like the ETF) does charge a management fee, which mean the ETN's returns will always be lower than the returns it is tracking by this fee.

-  On the next slide the difference between the [insert] ETN and the index it tracks is shown.

## ETNs and Exotic Underlyings

Because an ETN is a promise to pay an underlying's return, and the underlying doesn't actually have to be purchased, the ETN can track returns that ETFs may have a hard time replicating.  

-  For example, consider the [iPath® CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite IndexSM ETN](http://www.ipathetn.com/US/16/en/instruments.app#/details/19544) which tracks an index which simulates the retursn on a strategy of buying and wimultaneously writing call options on the S&P 500.

-  For another example there is the [iPath® Asian & Gulf Currency Revaluation ETN](http://www.ipathetn.com/US/16/en/instruments.app#/details/21845) which tracks a pegged currency index.

<!-- ## ETFs versus ETNs -->

<!-- -  Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) are unsecured debt obligations of financial institutions. -->
<!-- -  ETNs are also traded on securities exchanges and can be bought or sold on the exchanges. -->
<!-- -  ETNs unlike ETFs do not own a portfolio of underlying assets. ETNs calculate the value using a described formula, rather than using net asset value. -->
