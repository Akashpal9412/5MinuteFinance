<!--- change presentation to focus on the present state of treasury debt; who owns the debt and what types are outstanding --> 

## The Federal Debt

The US Treasury issues Treasury securities in order to finance the federal government's deficit---the amount by which federal spending exceeds receipts over any given time period.

-  The total debt amount [is posted here](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current) and is updated daily.  It is divided into debt held by the public (about $14 trillion), and debt held by the government (about $5 trillion).  The US federal government owns debt through various trust funds, for example for [Social Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Trust_Fund).

## Primary Market

The Treasury sells securities [in auctions](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_auctions_glance.htm).  In these auctions you can submit a *competitive* or *non-competitive* bid (a *bid* is the highest price you are willing to pay).   

-  Non-competitive: you specify a quantity only, and are willing to buy the security at the price resulting from the auction.  You are limited to non-competitive bids totaling \$5 million per auction.  

-  Competitive: you specify both a price and quantity.  

The auction price is determined by ranking the competitive bids (from highest to lowest) and accepting bids until the required funding is reached.  The lowest accepted bid is then applied as the purchase price for all competitive and non-competitive bids.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Secondary Market

There are about [22 primary dealers](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealers.html) who collectively make a secondary market in Treasury securities.  There are roughly 2,000 broker/dealers who are registered to do so, however the bulk of trading is done with the 22 primary dealers.

- When the Federal Reserve conducts open market operations it mainly trades with these primary dealers.

## Treasury Quotes

Treasury notes and bonds are quoted as a percent of par, with the number after the colon being the number of 32nds.  For example if a bond's price is quoted as 110:09, then it is trading for $110 + 9/32 = 110.28125$ percent of par.  Par value for Treasuries is \$1000, and so the bond's price is \$1102.8125.

Below is a bond quote-to-price converter.  Try entering in different quotes.


```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE, cache=FALSE}
#{{{
inputPanel(
    textInput("quote", "Price Quote", value = "110:09")
)
renderPrint({

    price <- (as.numeric(gsub(":[0-9]+$", "", x = input$quote)) + as.numeric(gsub("^[0-9]+:", "", x = input$quote)) / 32) * 10
    cat(paste0("$", price))

    })
#}}}
```

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Stripped Treasury Bonds

Treasury securities can be 'stripped' by primary dealers into principal and interest portions, which are often then sold as zero-coupon bonds.  

Zero-Coupon bonds are important to the financial industry because they:

#. Allow investors to guarantee the compounded return on investing in the bond.
#. Enable the creation of replicating portfolios for derivatives valuation and hedging.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

TIPS are Treasury securities with fixed coupon rates, but with principal amounts which are increased by the amount of U.S. inflation every 6 months.  

-  The coupon rate on TIPS is generally lower than the rate on typical US Treasury securities (of similar maturity).

-  Since the principal adjusts for inflation, the TIPS interest rate on TIPS is an estimate of the *real* interest rate.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Savings Bonds

Savings bonds are Treasury securities which are offered in denominations as low as \$25.  They mature in 30 years and do not have a secondary market.  They can, however, be redeemed early from the Treasury by paying a penalty.

-  [Series EE savings bonds:](http://treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_eebonds_glance.htm) interest rate is fixed.

-  [Series I savings bonds:](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm) interest rate adjusts with inflation.

Note, all of the previous treasury securities mentioned are exempt from state and local taxes, though not from federal taxes.

## Who Owns Treasury Debt?

Broadly, the US debt is held by 

-  foreign governments

-  individuals and corporations (both US based and foreign)

-  the US Federal Reserve

-  parts of the US government such as the Social Security Trust Fund and the Federal Housing Administration.

The following interactive app shows the major holders of US Treasury debt, and the proportion of the debt each owns over time.
