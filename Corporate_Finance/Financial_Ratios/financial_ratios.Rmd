## Motivation

Modern financial statements provide a great deal of data on companies.

[graphic: someone overwhelmed by data]

Financial ratios turn that data into bits of useful information.

-  They often do this, by scaling a data point relative to another aspect of the company.

Financial ratios are generally used to:

1.  Compare a single company's performance over time.
2.  Compare across companies.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## A Couple of Pointers

Financial ratios are most informative when used to compare companies in the *same* industry.

- You should never compare a bank's ratios with that of a biotech.  

- Know the good and bad values for a ratio.

- Use the right ratio to answer your question.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Categories

We can classify financial ratios into 5 categories:

- Leverage (or Long-Term Solvency)
- Liquidity (or Short-Term Solvency)
- Asset Use Efficiency
- Profitability
- Market Value Measures

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Leverage Ratios

These ratios measure the firm's long-term ability to meet its debt obligations.

- These are measures of overall assets relative to obligations.  They include assets which are hard to sell.

## Example: The Debt-to-Equity Ratio

The debt-to-equity ratio is a firm's total debt divided by its total equity.

-  If a firm has current assets of \$10 million, and current liabilities of \$8 million, then its current ratio is 1.25 times.
-  The value that this ratio takes is very industry specific.  Young firms tend to have little to no debt, and so low Debt-to-Equity ratios. More established firms may have higher ratios.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Liquidity Ratios

These ratios measure the firm's ability to meet its debt obligations over the short-term (over the next year).

- As an analogy, you can think of these as measuring how much money you have in your wallet.  You can't sell your house to pay your water bill this week.

## Example:  The Current Ratio

The current ratio is defined as the firm's current assets dividend by current liabilities.

-  If a firm has current assets of \$10 million, and current liabilities of \$8 million, then its current ratio is 1.25 times.
-  We don't want the current ratio to be too high (say above 2) or too low (say below 1). 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Asset Use Efficiency Ratios

These measure how efficiently a firms uses its assets.  For example, how much in sales does a firm generate from \$1.00 in assets.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Example: Total Asset Turnover

Total asset turnover is equal to sales divided by assets.

- Say a firm has \$500 million in sales, and its assets total \$2 billion.  Then it has a total asset turnover of 0.25 times.  We interpret is as, 'for every dollar in assets, the firm generates \$0.25 in sales'.  

- Of course, you would want to generate these sales with as few assets as possible.  So we would prefer our total asset turnover to be as high as possible. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Profitability Ratios

These measures focus on how well a firm translates a dollar of sales into income.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Example: Profit Margin

Say a firm has \$100 million in net income.  Alone this data point is not too useful.  However, what if we also say this income was generated on \$500 million in sales?

- Then we can say for every \$1 in sales, the company generates \$0.20 in income.

- Put another way, the company has a $\frac{\$100M}{\$500M} = 20\%$ profit margin. 

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Market Value Ratios

These measures capture what value the market assigns to each dollar of a firm's earnings, sales, or book value.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Example: P/E Ratio

A firm's P/E ratio is its stock price (per share) divided by its earnings per share (EPS).  If EPS is negative the ratio is undefined.

- Say a firm's P/E ratio is 15, then we can interpret this as, 'for every \$1 in earnings, the market is willing to pay \$15'.

- If a firm has negative EPS, then the ratio is undefined.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## When to Use a Ratio

If you are considering buying GE's stock.  Do you care about GE's current ratio?

>- Not really.  The current ratio only considers short term accounts, and as an equity holder you care about the firm's long-term prospects.  

>- You would certainly be interested in the Return on Equity, Debt-to-Equity ratio, and Total Asset Turnover among other measures of long-term performance.

## Interactive App

In the next slide you can choose two stocks, and one of four financial ratios, and see their performance over time.  

-  Remember, the comparison makes the most sense if you choose two stocks in the same industry.
