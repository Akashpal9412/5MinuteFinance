## Financial Statements

Financial statements are the main way in which a company communicates its performance to the market.

-  Audited statements are often required by bond and stock investors.

-  Financial statements are a major source of information with which to make financial decisions.

## Statements

The most important financial statements are:

1.  The Balance Sheet

2.  The Income Statement

3. The Cash Flow Statement  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The Balance Sheet

The balance sheet is a snapshot of the assets a firm owns, and how they are financed (i.e. its [capital structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_structure)).  Since every asset must be claimed by either stock or bond holders, we have the identity $Assets \equiv Liabilities + Stockholders'\ Equity$. 

- Note the use of $\equiv$ meaning 'is defined as' and not $=$ which means 'is equal to'.  An equation such as $x^2 - 2 = 0$ will only hold for some ([famous in the case of this equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2)) values of $x$.  However, the balance sheet identity will always hold.

- This is because of the definition of equity, which is whatever is left over after a company pays its debts.  So the value of equity is defined as $Assets - Liabilities$ and the balance sheet identity always holds.

## Balance Sheet Concepts

Following are three things to keep in mind while analyzing a balance sheet.

$1$.  Market Value versus Accounting (Book) Value:

-  Asset values are the price paid for the asset (assets are 'carried at cost').  This may differ markedly from the market value of an asset---the price at which you could sell the asset.

-  Some vital firm assets aren't listed on the balance sheet---employee knowledge and skills; proper managerial oversight; etc.

## Balance Sheet Concepts

$2$.  Leverage:

$3$.  Liquidity:

## The Income Statement

The income statement measures a firm's performance over some period of time.

-  If the balance sheet is a snapshot (picture) then the income statement is like a video recording.

-  Roughly, the income statement looks like: $Revenue - Expenses \equiv Income$.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The Cash Flow Statement 

The cash flow statement is a combination of balance sheet and income statement.

-  The statement captures how the changes in both balance sheet and income affects cash and cash equivalents.

-  There are three portions to the cash flow statement: Operating, Investing, and Financing activities.

## Interactive App

In the following interactive app you can query the balance sheet and income statement for any stock trading on US exchanges.

-  You can then search for any item using the search box.  As you type it will return all items which match your input.
-  You can also page through the statement in order with the page number on the bottom right.

## Interactive App

For example, search for Tesla's (TSLA) financial statements.  

- Place the cursor in the 'Stock's Name' box and hit backspace.  Type 'tesl' and you should see Tesla's common stock.  Hit 'Enter'.  

- On the income statement search for Operating Income and Net Income --- you only have to type "oper" and "net" and you should be able to see each.  Note both are negative.

- Then on the balance sheet search for Long-term Debt. You only have to type "long" and you should see it.  Note TSLA borrowed about \$1.3 billion in 2014.  

- Usually firms with positive Operating Income borrow heavily --- so they can reduce taxes through the interest tax shield.  TSLA, however, is choosing to finance its expansion with debt rather than equity.
