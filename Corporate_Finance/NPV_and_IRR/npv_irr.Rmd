## Introduction

In this interactive presentation we'll cover the most widely used investment decision rules: Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

- These rules are used to decide whether to invest in a project or asset.

-  It is important to note that, while NPV and IRR calculations give a number as an output, they are fed into a decision rule which is binary.  The final output from NPV and IRR is either *reject*, or *accept*, the investment.

## Net Present Value (NPV)

*Net Present Value* is the sum of the investment's expected cash inflows and outflows discounted back to their present value at a risk adjusted rate. If the Net Present Value is greater than \$0, the project is accepted. Otherwise the project is rejected. 

The Net Present Value is defined by its: 

- $r$ the discount rate per period
- $n$ the number of periods
- $C$ the cash flow per period
- $C_0$ the initial investment

$NPV = -C_0 + \frac{C_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2} + ... + \frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n}$

## NPV: Interpretation

NPV can be interpreted as the amount the market value of the firm will increase/decrease if the project is accepted.

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

*Internal Rate of Return* is the discount rate ($r_{IRR}$) that makes the Net Present Value equal zero. It is normally used to compare projects. Projects with a higher IRR above a set threshold are accepted.

$-C_0 + \frac{C_1}{(1+r_{IRR})^1} + \frac{C_2}{(1+r_{IRR})^2} + ... + \frac{C_n}{(1+r_{IRR})^n} = 0$

## Choosing Between Projects

When the accept/reject decision on one project does not affect another project, these projects are known as **independent**.  If accepting one project means you must reject another, then these projects are **mutually exclusive**. 

If a project has negative cash flows followed by all positive cash flows, then the project's cash flows are known as **conventional**

-  If two projects are independent and have conventional cash flows, then NPV and IRR will lead to the same accept/reject decision, i.e. $NPV \iff IRR$

-  However, if you must rank projects, and projects are either mutually exclusive or cash flows are not conventional, then use NPV.  NPV will generate the correct decision, though IRR may not.
