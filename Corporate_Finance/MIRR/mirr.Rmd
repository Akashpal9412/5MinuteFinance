## Multiple Internal Rates of Return (IRRs)

A problem with the IRR investment decision rule, is if the cash flows from a project change signs *X* times, then there are up to *X* IRRs for the project.  

-  The problem is no one IRR is more correct than another, and so the multiple IRRs may give differing accept/reject decisions.  

-  In the following interactive app, enter cash flows, and the app will try to return all valid IRRs.

## Interactive App

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(financial)
inputPanel(
    numericInput("cf0", "Cash Flow at Time 0", value = -100),
    numericInput("cf1", "Cash Flow at Time 0", value = 300),
    numericInput("cf2", "Cash Flow at Time 0", value = -200),
    numericInput("cf3", "Cash Flow at Time 0", value = 10)
)

renderTable({

    ## read in IRR function
    ## source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FinancialMarkets/corpfin/master/irr.R")
    
    cfs <- c(input$cf0, input$cf1, input$cf2, input$cf3)

    ## irrs <- 0

    ## for(i in seq(-100, 100, by = .5)){
    ##     irrs[i] <- round(irr(cfs)$IRR, 2)
    ## }

    ## unique(irrs)

    out <- as.data.frame(cf(cfs)[2]$irr)
    names(out) <- "IRRs (in %)"
    out

})
```

## Modified IRR (MIRR)

We can solve the multiple IRR formula by putting the cash flows into *conventional* form. By *conventional* we mean cash outflows followed by cash inflows, so there is only one chance in the sign of the cash flows.

- We do so by moving cash flows in time at a *discount rate*, until the cash flows are conventional.

- Note a potential benefit of the IRR approach was that it did not require a discount rate (though it does require a threshold rate).

## MIRR Example

Say we have the following cash flows (the default in the above app):

| Year | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| ---- |---|---|---|---|
| Cash Flow | -100 | 300 | -200 | 50 |

Assume the discount rate is 8%.  Then we can move the -\$200 in year two to year 1. This affords the following modified cash flows:

| Year | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| ---- |---|---|---|---|
| Cash Flow | -100 | 114.81 | 0 | 50 |

## Net Present Value (NPV)

Given MIRR requires a discount rate, and still suffers from the [loss of scale problem](INSERT LINK), it makes sense to simply use NPV.
