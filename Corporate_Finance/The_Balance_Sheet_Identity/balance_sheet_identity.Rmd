##  How do we Buy Assets?

You issue financial assets (stocks and bonds) to get the money to buy real assets.  These financial assets then have a claim on the assets, and the cash flows generated by those assets.  

- The type of financial assets determines the nature (risk/return) of the claim. 

-  Bond and stock valuation deals with the claim on the cash flows.  Here we'll discuss the claim on the underlying assets themselves.

## The Balance Sheet Identity: $A \equiv L + SE$

where *A* denotes assets, *L* liabilities, and *SE* stockholders' equity.
