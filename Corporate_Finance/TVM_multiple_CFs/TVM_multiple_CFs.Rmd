## Introduction

In this presentation we'll cover the valuation of contracts that are comprised of multiple cash flows.  These contracts will cover:

- Annuities
- Perpetuities
- Growing Annuities and Perpetuities 
- Irregular Cash Flows

## Annuities

An **annuity** is a contract which pays a fixed amount at the end of each period for a fixed number of periods.  Many common financial contract are annuities, such as fixed rate mortgage and auto loans.  If the payments are in the beginning of a period (such as renting an apartment) the contract is known as an *annuity due*.

The annuity is defined by its: 

- $r$ the rate per period
- $n$ the number of periods
- $C$ the cash flow per period

It is important that each quantity you use is over the same period, i.e. don't use a yearly rate with monthly payments.

## The Present Value of an Annuity

To calculate the present value of an annuity we can simply discount each payment individually, to the same period, and sum them.  In other words we can:

$PV_0 = \frac{C}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + ... + \frac{C}{(1+r)^n}$

Note the PV is at time 0 (one period before the first payment in time 1).  This calculation is very easy to do in a spreadsheet.  However annuities are old, so historically we have used a simplified version of the above equation.  Specifically the above is equal to:  

$PV_0 = C(\frac{1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}}{r})$

## PV of an Annuity Calculator

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
inputPanel(
	   sliderInput("rate", label = "Interest Rate per Period", min = 0, max = 0.5, step = .01, value = .05),
	   sliderInput("periods", label = "Number of Periods", min = 1, max = 50, step = 1, value = 10),
	   sliderInput("cash", label = "Cash Flow per Period", min = 0, max = 100000, step = 10, value = 100)
	   )

renderPlot({
cashFlows <- rep(input$cash, input$periods)
pv <- sum( cashFlows / ((1 + input$rate) ^ {1:input$periods}) )
  plot(0, ylim = c(0,1), xlim = c(0,1), type = "n", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", ylab = "", xlab = "")
  text(x = 0.5, y = 0.5, labels = paste(round(pv, 2)), cex = 5)
})
```

## The Future Value (FV) of an Annuity

## Future Value
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#{{{
inputPanel(
	   sliderInput("rate", label = "Annual Interest Rate", min = -.05, max = 0.5, step = .01, value = .05),
	   sliderInput("years", label = "Number of Years", min = 1, max = 50, step = 1, value = 10)
	   #            sliderInput("pv", label = "Present Value", min = 1, max =50, step = 1, value = 10),
	   )

renderPlot({
  fv <- (1 + input$rate)^{1:input$years}
  fv <- c(1, fv)
  plot(fv, type = 'l', lwd = 3, col = 3, ylab = "$", xlab = "Years")
  legend("topleft", "Future Value of $1", col = 3, lwd = 3, lty = 1)
})
#}}}
```


[Should we put a calculator which will return *FV*, *PV*, *r*, and *n* given the other inputs?]

## A Growing Annuity

A **growing annuity** is a contract which pays a constantly increasing amount at the end of each period for a set number of periods.

-  For example, the following is a growing annuity:  a contract which pays $\$100$ in the next period, and $\$100(1 + r)^n$ in period $n$, where $n$ ranges from 1 to some final period $N$, and $r$ is the growth rate per period.  The value of a growing annuity at time $0$ is:


## Perpetuity

A **perpetuity** is a contract which pays a fixed amount at the end of each period for an infinite number of periods. 

## A Growing Perpetuity

A **growing perpetuity** is a contract which pays a constantly increasing amount at the end of each period for an infinite number of periods.

-  For example, the following is a growing perpetuity:  a contract which pays $\$100$ in the next period, and $\$100(1 + r)^n$ in period $n$, where $n$ ranges from 1 to infinity, and $r$ is the growth rate per period.  The value of a growing perpetuity (assuming the discount rate is greater than the cash flow growth rate)  at time $0$ is:

## Irregular Cash Flows

A contract with **Irregular cash flows** is any contract that has a cash flow structure other than those listed above.

-  As mentioned earlier, annuity formulas allowed computationally easy valuation, and therefore use, of the above contracts.  However present computing power makes valuation of any stream of cash flows very easy.  

-  So the valuation of irregular cash flows can simply be done by applying the formulas for single cash flows to each individual cash flow in the contract.
