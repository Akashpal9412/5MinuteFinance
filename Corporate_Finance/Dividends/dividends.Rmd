## Dividends 

In general, any payment made directly from the corporation to shareholders is a *dividend*.

-  Often these are cash payments made from *earnings*.  If they are cash dividends from other sources than earnings (selling equipment for example) they are referred to as *liquidating dividends* or as *distributions*.

-  Dividends can also be paid in *stock*. A stock dividend increases the number of shares outstanding, and does not represent a cash payment.

A corporation's Board of Directors sets *dividend policy*.

## Making a Cash Dividend Payment

There are 4 steps in the payment of a cash dividend.  

1.  First the dividend must be *declared*.  This date is important because the firm is not required to pay dividends.  However once the dividend is declared by the Board of Directors, it becomes a liability of the firm.  

2.
