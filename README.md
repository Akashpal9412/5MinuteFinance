# Interactive Presentations

This is a project to create freely available financial education materials. The materials are (now) interactive presentations written in [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and use [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) for interactive the content.  The presentations are hosted on shinyapps.io, and can be viewed by following the links below.  

# Contributions are Welcome!

This initiative will be increasingly successful as more people from the finance community contribute.  Presently, financial education materials are duplicated through separate efforts by individuals and organizations. This is particularly true for materials targeting the undergraduate level.

We hope to foster a community effort to create a set of finance education and course materials. Collaboration and attribution are managed through GitHub.

## Ways to contribute.

You can contribute with very little knowledge of Git/GitHub, and no knowledge of R/Shiny.  All you need is a GitHub account.  We are in the process of creating basic tutorials on contributing. We'll post them here, but you can also get started with GitHub's excellent list of documentation: https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/

If you are familiar with Git/R/Shiny then feel free to add text and code!
