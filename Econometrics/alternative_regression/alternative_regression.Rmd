## The Geometric Viewpoint

This presentation will look at linear regression from the geometric viewpoint.  The approach is often taken once the student has taken a course in linear algebra.  

- For a traditional introduction to linear regression see [this presentation]().  

## What is Linear Regression?

Linear regression is the projection of your dependent variable ($y$) into the vector space spanned by your independent variables ($x_i$).  

- OK, so that is a highly technical definition which requires some linear algebra knowledge.  But bear with me because it will make sense shortly.  Say for now we have two independent variables, $x_1$ and $x_2$.

-  What the above definition means is we choose parameters (the $\beta$ coefficients) so that $\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2$ is as close to how $y$ behaves as possible.  Since $\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2$ is linear function, regression gives us a linear approximation of $y$.

-  All that is left is to define "close" and find a method to find the $\beta$ which maximizes the closeness.
