## Monte Carlo and Analytic Solutions

When an analytic solution is available use it.  

-  Monte Carlo is useful when an analytic solution is unavailable or difficult to obtain.

-  If you make the same underlying assumptions, the analytic solution will be the same as the Monte Carlo.

## Example: European Option Pricing

Assuming stock follows a geometric Brownian Motion, then at time $T$ in the future we have: 

$S_T = S_0 e^{(\mu - \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)T + \sigma B_T}$

where $S_0$ is the stock price today, $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are the stock's drift and volatility respectively, and $B_T$ is the value of a Brownian Motion at time $T$.

-  Since $B_T \sim N(0, T)$, we can create random draws from $B_T$ by drawing from $N(0, 1)$ and multiplying by $T$. 

-  For each draw of $B_T$ we get a new value of $S_T$.

## Drift and Volatility

We estimate volatility $\sigma$ using historical or forward looking measures (depending on our assumptions [link to presentation]).  However, in a Black-Scholes world the market is complete, and so we can set the drift $\mu$ equal to the risk free rate $r_f$.  

-  Therefore each simulated stock price at time $T$ is:

$S_T = S_0 e^{(r_f - \frac{1}{2}\hat{\sigma}^2)T + \hat{\sigma} N(0, 1)T}$  

where $N(0, 1)$ is a random draw from a standard Normal distribution.

```{r echo = FALSE}
#{{{
max.rands <- 1000000
inputPanel(
    sliderInput(inputId = "rands", label = "Number of Random Numbers in Monte Carlo", min = 50, max = max.rands, step = 10000, value = 50, animate = TRUE)
    ## numericInput(inputId = "seed", label = "Set Seed (to make reproducible)", value = 1, min = 1, max = 99999999)
    ## add radioButton input for antithetic sampling?
)

S <- 50
K <- 45
r <- 0.01
vol <- 0.2
T <- 0.5

## Monte Carlo estimate of premium:
## this can likely be sped up substantially by refactoring.  Can use C++/Rcpp also.
## old really slow way (find out why so slow)
                                        # for (i in 1:max.rands) {
                                        #   z <- rnorm(1)
                                        #   call[i] <- exp(-r*T)*ifelse(S*exp((r - .5 * vol * vol)*T + vol*sqrt(T)*z) > K, S*exp((r - .5*vol * vol)*T + vol*sqrt(T)*z) - K, 0)
                                        # }

## New (much faster)
set.seed(seed = 1)
z <- rnorm(max.rands)
stock <- S*exp((r - .5 * vol * vol)*T + vol*sqrt(T)*z)
calls <- stock - K
calls[calls < 0] <- 0

## Black-Scholes Premium: 
d1 <- (1 / (vol * sqrt(T))) * (log(S / K) + (r + vol * vol / 2) * T)
d2 <- d1 - vol * sqrt(T)
call.bs <- pnorm(d1) * S - pnorm(d2) * K * exp(-r * T)


renderPlot({ 
    subset.calls <- exp(-r*T)*calls[1:input$rands]
### possibly change output from a density -- something which also shows the variability of the estimate.
    hist(subset.calls, main = paste0("Call Premium $", round(mean(subset.calls), 2)), xlab = "Call Option Value", breaks = 100, freq = FALSE, width = "100%")
    legend('topright', c(paste0("Black-Scholes Value $", round(call.bs, 2)), paste0("Difference $", round(abs(call.bs - mean(subset.calls)), 2))))
})
#}}}

## Pricing Path-Dependent Options

As mentioned, Monte Carlo makes sense when an analytic solution is unavailable or its solution is intractable.  This is often the case for *path-dependent* options, where payoffs are a function of the stock prices over some interval---the path the stock took to get to its present price.  Examples of such options are:

- American Options: can be exercised prior to expiration.

- Lookback Options: payoff is a function of the maximum (or minimum) stock price over the interval.

- Asian Options: payoff is a function of the average stock price over the interval.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Lookback Option

Say an option gives you the right to sell one unit of the underlying at the maximum price from today (time $0$) until expiration (time $T$).  This is a lookback put option.  

-  If we assume the underlying follows geometric Brownian motion, then this option value [has an analytic solution](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=goldman+sosin+gatto+1979).

-  However what if your boss wants you to value a lookback option on an underlying which is described by the following process?

$dS_t = \kappa(\mu_S - lnS_t)dt + \sigma S_t dB_t$

-  An analytic solution might be possible, but it may take a while to find. This is where it makes sense to turn to Monte Carlo.
