##

```{r echo = FALSE}
inputPanel(
    sliderInput(inputId = "reps", label = "Number of Monte Carlo Runs", min = 50, max = 500, step = 1, value = 1)
    ## add radioButton input for antithetic sampling?
)

## want the app to print a histogram of all the monte carlo estimates at the end of each run.  See the code here to implement: https://gist.github.com/trestletech/8608815

renderPlot({ 
        S <- 50
        K <- 45
        r <- 0.01
        vol <- 0.2
        T <- 0.5
        call <- 0
        for (i in 1:input$reps){
            z <- rnorm(1000000)
            call[i] <- exp(-r*T)*mean(ifelse(S*exp((r-.5*vol^2)*T+vol*sqrt(T)*z)>K, S*exp((r-.5*vol^2)*T+vol*sqrt(T)*z)-K, 0))
        }
### possibly change output from a density -- something which also shows the variability of the estimate.
        plot(density(call), main = "Monte Carlo Value of a European Call", sub = "Call Option Value")
    })

```
