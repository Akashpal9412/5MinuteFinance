## Why Short Stock?

By shorting stock we profit when the stock price declines.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Other Reasons

Shorting stock is also used by banks to hedge put options they have sold, and other derivative positions.

[graphic: not sure]

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## So How Does It Work?

To short a share of stock, you borrow the stock from someone (say Bob) and sell it to someone else (say Sandra).  Say you sold it to Sandra for \$100.  The cash balance in your account will increase by \$100, and you will hold a -1 position in the stock.  

-  Eventually, you'll have to return the stock to Bob to close our your short position.

-  To return the stock to Bob, you'll go to the market and buy a share.  You can buy it from anyone, not just Sandra.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Example Profit/Loss

Say the stock is trading in the market for \$80 when you decide to close the position.

-  To close the postion, you buy the stock for \$80 and return it to Bob.

-  After the transaction you are left with a profit of \$100 - \$80 = \$20.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Example Profit/Loss

Alternatievly, say the stock is trading in the market for \$110 when you decide to close the position.

-  To close the postion, you buy the stock for \$110 and return it to Bob.

-  So you sold the stock for \$100, and bought it for \$110, for a loss of \$10.

##  Interactive App

On the next slide you can input the amount of shares you want to short, and the prices at which you open and close the short position.

-  The app shows each transaction made in the course of the short sale, and also your ultimate profit.

-  A negative profit is a loss.

-  Complete lines open the short position, and dotted lines close the short.

## How Do You Borrow Shares?

This is handled by your broker -- you don't have to worry about the mechanics behind the scenes.

-  Essentially what happens is you broker will borrow the shares from a large investor or mutual fund.

-  Sometimes your broker doesn't think it will be able to borrow shares, and will indicate the stock is not available for shorting.

-  Note, you don't have any sort of right to short, so during times of market turbulence, you may not be able to short many stocks.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Naked Shorting

Your broker has some leeway in terms of how soon they have to borrow shares however -- generally they have a few days.

-  In the past however, some brokers never bothered to borrow the shares.

-  The term for shorting while failing to borrow the stock is 'Naked Shorting' and it has been banned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

##  Alternatives to Shorting: Inverse ETFs

If you don't want to short (or your brokerage account doesn't allow it), you can simply buy an inverse [Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)](link_to_ETF_presentation).

-  Buying an inverse ETF on a portfolio will afford a return very similar to shorting the portfolio.

-  Inverse ETFs are not available for individual stocks.

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Inverse ETF Performance

The next slide shows the performance of an ETF on the S&P 500 (SPY), and an inverse ETF on the S&P 500 (SH).

-  To zoom in or focus on a subinterval, use the range selector at the bottom of the chart.

-  You can see the inverse (short) ETF is a mirror image of the performance of the S&P 500.

## Does Shorting Create Shares?

Short answer: No.

In our example, Bob ownes a share, we *owe* one share, and Sandra ownes a share.  The number of shares outstanding are 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.

-  So as long as the shares are actually borrowed (it is not a naked short), shorting has no effect on the float.
