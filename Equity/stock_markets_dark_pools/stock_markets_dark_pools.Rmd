## Dark Pools

In addition to national and regional stock exchanges, some organizations have set up *Dark Pools*.

-  If you send an order to an exchange, the order can be seen by the public.  Also trades on a public exchange generate information which is then reflected on other public exchanges.  

-  In a dark pool you can send an indication of interest to buy or sell a stock, and this indication is only available to those with access to the dark pool. Also trades in the dark pool are not quickly made known to public exchanges.

## Why Trade in Dark Pools?

The benefit of sending an order to a dark pool is that you may be able to hide large orders. 

-  Say you send a large buy order to an exchange.  When your intentions become public, the price will tend to increase causing you to have to pay more for the shares. 

Despite trading in a dark pool, you should still receive no worse than the best bids and offers among public exchanges.  

-  However, dark pools may not presently report trades within the pool with the accuracy required to enforce deviations from the best bids and offers.  

## Who Operates Dark Pools?

Dark pools are run by (1) independent organizations, (2) broker-dealers such as JP Morgan, Credit Suisse, and Fidelity, and (3) public exchanges.  

-  There are about 40 dark pools today.

## Information Transfer with Public Exchanges 

Dark pools might show up in our network as independent nodes. 

-  This is because trade and quote information is hidden from public exchanges.  So trades in the dark pool will not generate information flow to other exchanges. 

-  Dark pools show up in light orange in the following network graphic.
