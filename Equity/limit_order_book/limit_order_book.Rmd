## The Limit Order Book

The *limit order book* is the list of orders (prices at which you can transact) for a given security.

-  Depending on the security, these orders may be on one exchange, or aggregated across many exchanges.

-  This presentation will give a basic description of the orderbook, and how your transactions will be handled by (and effect) the book.

## Order Book Description

The plot on the right in the next slide shows the full orderbook -- sell orders from \$11.38 to about \$12.50, and buy orders from \$11.36 down to about \$10.20.

-  We generally only show the book 5 or 10 levels deep, as in the graphic on the left which shows the book 5 levels deep.

Example: reading the first 2 levels of the book:

-  There are 400 shares being offered for sale at 11.38, and 1600 shares offered at 11.39.  This means, if we wish, we can buy shares at these prices.  

-  Similarly there are 2700 shares being being bid for at 11.36, and 1100 shares being bid for at 11.35.  This means, if we wish, we can sell shares at these prices.

## Inside Quotes

The *inside quotes*, which are also known as the *Best Bid and Offer* or *BBO*, are the highest bid, and lowest ask, in the orderbook.  

- They are the prices at which the next market buy (with the best offer) or market sell (with the best bid) will transact.

- In the above book the *inside quotes* are 11.36/11.38.  

In this case the bid/ask spread is \$11.36 - \$11.38 = \$0.02, or $\frac{\$0.02}{\$11.38} = 0.1757\%$.

-  The bid/ask percentage spread measures the cost to transact in that security---the larger the spread the larger the transaction costs.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## Orderbook and Liquidity

The smaller the bid/ask spread, and the more limit orders in the book, the greater the security's *liquidity*.  

-  *Liquidity* is a measure of your ability to cheaply transact (buy or sell) a security without moving the inside quotes by much.  

-  Sufficient liquidity is an integral component of a well-functioning market.  

<div class="MIfooter"><img src="mi.png" style="height:50px;"></div> 

## The [Market Maker](https://www.sec.gov/answers/mktmaker.htm)

A *Market Maker* job is to maintain, at all times, bids and offers in the orderbook.  This provides liquidity to the market.  

-  The market maker attempts to earn the bid/ask spread -- repeatedly buying at the bid and selling at the ask.

-  The orderbook is comprised of limit orders from the market maker, as well as other investors and traders.  However, the market maker **must** maintain orders in the book, and other market participants do not.

## Limit Orders as Options

Limit buy/sell orders in the book can also be thought of as providing the *option* to sell/buy the security at the limit price.  

## Orderbook R Package

The interactive content in this presentation has used the [orderbook R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/orderbook/index.html).

-  A big thanks to the package authors for this great tool.
